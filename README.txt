GalenZ TES5Edit Scripts Repository - README
This file last updated: 2015-04-04

This repository contains my TES5Edit scripts, which can do some useful things in TES5Edit.

Any of these scripts can be installed by simply coying them in the 'EditScripts/' folder of your base Skyrim folder (e.g. C:/Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim).
